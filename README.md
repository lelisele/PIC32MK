# PIC32MK and PIC32MX test_examples
This folder contains several one page files in C that could be useful to implement interface to different peripheries as UART, ADC, SPI, PWM etc... on the deeply integrated PIC32MK and PIC321MX devices. This PIC32MK knowing its large memory, 32-bits CPU, large number of motion interfaces as QEI, Analog Amplifier and Compactor, synchronized and complex ADC, internal DAC, complex and high performance PWM block, SPI, I2C etc. is extremely  useful to develop any motion control application.

Unfortunately, its documentation is not exhaustive (as example I2C interface) and is missing different examples. That is why, we've profited and isolated some example from our applications. The main idea was to implement simple, one page listing against some times so complex and large as example generated by Harmony. Type of the interface presented in example is indicated in its title. Additionally, for some examples we've included the MPLAB's compatible project but also some measures (oscilloscope screen-shots) **(see ReadMe-R09.pdf description)**. 

All examples are tested on the developed  Control Driver  (PIC32MK) board and applied into different  applications as a main part of the IMCS (Intelligent Motion Control System) **(see CD-PIC32MKdescription.pdf description)**.
